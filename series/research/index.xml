        <description>Three new timescales for the Devonian.
  The biotic, climatic, and tectonic events of the Devonian cannot be correlated and investigated without a well-calibrated time scale. In our new paper out today lead by Claire Harrigan we recalibrated the Geologic Time Scale for the Devonian using three different conodont bio zone schemes, new U-Pb geochronology and a new approach to integrating Bayesian age depth modeling and astrochronologic constraints. The paper is available now in GSA Bulletin, and the modeling code is available on Github.</description>

  Grey wolves (Canis lupus) are one of the most widespread terrestrial carnivores and one of the largest to have survived the late Pleistocene extinctions. A new paper I&amp;rsquo;m a coauthor on shows that wolves from the Canadian Yukon were able to survive the extinctions in part because of their flexible diets.</description>
